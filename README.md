# Extension Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

None of the extensions I write collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

## Chrome Storage API

Several of my extensions take advantage of [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store minimal state information. This is similar to a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies). My extensions only access this data locally on your machine and they do not transmit it. 

## Third-Party APIs

I am not using any thrid party api's

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If our data practices change in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
